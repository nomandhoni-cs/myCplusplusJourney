# Introduction to C++
##### Low level Programming Language
That means C++ programs run close to hardware, C++ is commonly used in operating system. You can access the memory by function and use pointer.
##### Speed of Execution
C++ doesn't come with garbage collection like Java and Python does also C++ does not use interpreter that's why C++ gives us a speedy runtime.
##### Derived from C
C was the language before C++ to write close to hardware program, but C didn't had OOP that's why C++ came in.
##### Richer library than C
C++ offers more libary than C, it offers one of the great libary called STL (Standard Template Libbary) which can be used in CP and software development.
##### Object Oriented Programming
C++ Offers you to do Object Oriented Programming and that's why this is called C++.
